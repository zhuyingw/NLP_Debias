Evaluation of the de-biasing capabilities of TST models

Text style transfer aims to change the style of the input text to the target
styles while preserving the main content of the message. The state-of-art
text style transfer models, such as GPT-3, are trained using the data on the
Internet, which contains many instances of biased language and descriptions.
If future researchers want to use large language models with methods like
augmented zero-shot learning or other models built with the Internet, it is
important to understand how much bias was built within. In this research,
we assess the level by testing how the models can de-bias biased statements.
By conducting the research, we make the attempt to construct safer models
for future uses.
